After I had managed to fail my first year at University I was scared as to what I was going to do with my future. I didn't want a mundane 9-5 job and yet I didn't know if I could pay my way through an unsubsidized year at university to settle down and continue my studies.

Like guilt - the most ashamed I have ever felt was when I began to feel guilty about having sex with my boyfriend when it was only the thing to do, and not an act of love.
This feeling of guilt applies to moral/religious views. I (being Catholic) went against what I was brought up to believe in and had a sexual relationship with my boyfriend.

My mother along with some of my friends gave me a surprise birthday party - they invited a large number of my friends along too.

My anger is with men, and their inability to be human (not all men).
The saddest I've ever been was when my lover was killed, a hitch-hiking to work.
With the N.Z. Rugby Union wanted to send the All Blacks to South Africa.
That my brother and father are into alcohol, two men with a privilege. Not using it positively.
When I betrayed my lover, she told me something in confidence, I felt at the time I had to relay the information back to the person concerned, as I felt the situation volatile, did this without telling my lover, and she felt like piggy in the middle, as a she was not directly concerned. Maybe you could call it to gossip I a felt different after I had slept on it. If I had waited, thought, a NOW I would not have done it.
A good friend, the wife of the vicar of my church came up to me from the pews (I am in the choir) and shook my hand during the time for an informal greeting in the church service. She said a few words.

My friend replied to my letter again saying he was attracted to me and suggesting we write, talk and get together and see how things went his suggestion that I could ring and do that was really good - though really insane conversation.
Being sexually assaulted (not rape, but passionate kissing) by a friend's father - he stopped when he was driving me home. I hadn't wanted the lift, had refused 3 times, and then felt it'd be rude to refuse again. Was really afraid of what he might do.
I live by myself and a few weeks ago was woke by a man on the end of my bed coming up my bed at me. I was really angry and told him to get out. He was surprised and hesitated, I started to move towards him and he backed off - kept telling him - loudly, but firmly to go. Because I'd got the initiative, I succeeded. A very powerful message.
When my grandmother died - I wasn't sad so much that she'd died because she was old, but because she lived for the last few years in an old people's home and had nothing very much that was hers - a no chair, or private space, and when I went to visit she would be a sitting in the living room the TV room.

I experience this emotion quite often but the day I was most angry was the day I got pulled up for something I had not done. It happened during my school days, I had not spoken a word in class but the monitor had written my name on the board. So I had a remark in my calendar which I had to get signed by my parents. This remark resulted in me being spanked.
I have once been very sad and lonely. This was when I was trying to organize a play as a student (15 years). Instead of materializing, it fizzled out. The worst thing was that the play fell apart completely and I found myself weeping uncontrollably. a Now when I think of it, I laugh it off, but at that time it was intense.
This is an incident that many of us witness in our everyday life in a city like Bombay. One day I was travelling by bus, and three men dragged two fellows out of the bus. Once outside they were beaten into a pulp. These two fellows, who got beaten, were pick-pockets and they were being beaten by all and sundry. I thought to myself - what is life? It is one hell of a place where everyone is after someone else. One waits to cut the throat of the other one just for a living, (money). When I think about such things - the purpose of life, etc, I feel very disgusted and dejected.
This is an event I will never forget. I am considered a good mimic. On this particular day, we were waiting for a professor to take her class. This professor had a peculiar accent and a very horrible way of lecturing and to top it all we had this class at the fag end of the day. So this particular day I got into my element and started imitating the professor, and the professor entered the class right in the middle of it. I was unaware of her presence, some of my friends tried to warn me but it was of no avail as I was too engrossed in mimicking. Then I suddenly noticed the silence and turned around to see her entering the class. I do not know till today if she actually saw what I had been doing or if she had completely ignored it. Throughout that lecture, I died of shame. All the more shameful was the fact that she gave me a character certificate. 
This happened when it was finally confirmed that I had stood first in the university for the M.A. exams. A few days before the official results were declared a clerk had brought the results unofficially. So I had been expecting the results but the confirmation allowed me to legitimately feel happy at my success. a 
This was when I was being followed home every day from the campus, by a stranger. He would follow me to the campus and then sit outside my class. If I was not there he would ask my friends where I was. He was a dark, ominous-looking person and I was terrified of him as I did not know his intentions. I reported him to the security officer, who turned him over to the police. an I was even more petrified then.
A new gas connection was to be installed and the mechanic who came to do it was very rude to my mother and me.

The day I was to receive my gold medal for the M.A., my grandmother, who I loved very much, died after an illness. She died a few hours before the convocation.

I can particularly a remember this incident as she knew that I had not encouraged the a guy.
I was learning judo and my instructor wanted me to assist him in a teaching girls judo at a suburban college. I was just a beginer, a and he made me a green belt so that I would be able to command a respect. This was against my principles, and yet I allowed myself a to listen to him. I gave it up soon after, however I felt very a ashamed at not sticking to my principles and at not having put my a foot down earlier.

It was a week before the higher level results were announced. I a had tried and failed many times and this was the last time that a I was taking the exam. I knew that if i failed again I woulld a have to enter the society. I imagined things during this period a - I dreamt that I had entered university and it was a nice a experience. When I thought about the future, an unexplainable a fear rose in me. I feared being a worker and not having a bright a prospect, I also feared the criticism of my relatives as my a brother had gone to university.

In August,1983, the long awaited big envelope (a document for aC.U.H.K admission) arrived. It was in the afternoon and I had anot been doing anything.

I hurriedly aopened the envelope and my mood at that time is hard to describe. a It lasted several hours and only calmed down later.
On Christmas eve,1984, I had just finished the exams and was a afraid as the results of one of my major subjects had been very a unsatisfactory. I thought that I had only a 50% chance of a passing. Even if I failed this subject I would not need to a repeat. However I liked this subject very much and my results a were bad because of my lazyness. If I was forced to change to a a minor in this subject I would be very unwilling.
In September 1984, I was forced to live with someone I did not a like. The first week we were at loggerheads and our conversation a was like a debate. The atmosphere was very bad. When he learnt a that I had got 95 marks in a test he told me A failure, You lost a5 marks.  I was very angry, not because my marks were lower athan his, but because I could not tolerate his pride. I did not ashow my discontentment and carried on doing my work.
This issue worried me rather than saddening me. In mid September a I went to Guanggho alone. I was looking for an accomodation in a the evening and after having walked 2 or 3 miles I still could not a find anything. What could I do? I was not worried about a sleeping on the streets but because of some procedural problems. a I finally found a place to sleep at 8 o'clock.
My roommate liked to listen to some meaningless songs which had a melody but had no content. We lived together so when he played a the recorder I was forced to listen to them.

Last Summer I went camping with some C.U students. As I was a working then, I had to leave the second night (some of them had a joined us the first night).

Two years back someone invited me to be the tutor of her a grand-daughter. The grand-daughter asked me some questions in a mathematics so I taught her. However she did not listen to me a and this made me feel unhappy. The second year it was the same. a When I entered university the girl's parents suggested that I be a employed as their daghters tutor. They told me that at university a there was no homework and I would have a lot of time so they a made a time-table for me which required me to be the tutor five a days a week. They did not respect me and anyway I had another a child to teach.
I had taken the responsibility to do something and I had a prepared for it. However I failed because of my timidity. After a three attempts I still could not adapt to the atmosphere and a failed as before. I felt imcompetent and felt that the others a would think that I had not prepared for it.
