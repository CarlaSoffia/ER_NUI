anger;My friend often played a joke on me and sometimes I thought that a he was a nonsensical person. Once when we went to a friend's a house he walked in first and shut the door firmly behind him.

sadness;I suddenly found that those whom I considerered to be my good a friends did not care for me. Although I could still be with them a I felt unimportant.

I was a sad when I decided that they were no longer my good friends.
disgust;I had a friend who was very kind to me. I tried my best to like a him and understand him but when I was with him I could not help a rejecting, criticizing and blaming him. I wanted to get away a from him as soon as possible.

A close  a friend of mine, who is also a classmate, told me that my a application for a Japanese inter-cultural exchange programme had a been accepted.

When I met my classmates and friends I told them the a good news. I was so happy that I could not concentrate on my a studies. a 
fear;A boy phoned me at night and wanted to talk to me for 30 minutes a outside. I thought that he would reveal what he felt and would a question me on our relationship.

I was very a unhappy as I feared having hurt him and got him into trouble.

guilt;At secondary school, one of my classmates lost her locker key. a During a class I saw two other classmates holding a key and a talking secretly. I do not know why I suspected them, also a another classmate supported me.

fear;It was a week before the higher level results were announced. I a had tried and failed many times and this was the last time that a I was taking the exam. I knew that if i failed again I woulld a have to enter the society. I imagined things during this period a - I dreamt that I had entered university and it was a nice a experience. When I thought about the future, an unexplainable a fear rose in me. I feared being a worker and not having a bright a prospect, I also feared the criticism of my relatives as my a brother had gone to university. Whenevr I thought of this issue a I could not eat or concentrate, and my heart beat increased.

disgust;At hostel, my roommate was a very selfish person and would avoid a doing anyhting that did not concern him. A few of us prepared lunch a together and had decided to share the work. My roomate had a promised to do the same but I had to wash the bowls everytime a after dinner. I tried to wait and thought that he would realize a his fault.

joy;In August,1983, the long awaited big envelope (a document for aC.U.H.K admission) arrived. It was in the afternoon and I had anot been doing anything.

I hurriedly aopened the envelope and my mood at that time is hard to describe. a It lasted several hours and only calmed down later.
fear;On Christmas eve,1984, I had just finished the exams and was a afraid as the results of one of my major subjects had been very a unsatisfactory. I thought that I had only a 50% chance of a passing. Even if I failed this subject I would not need to a repeat. However I liked this subject very much and my results a were bad because of my lazyness. If I was forced to change to a a minor in this subject I would be very unwilling.
anger;In September 1984, I was forced to live with someone I did not a like. The first week we were at loggerheads and our conversation a was like a debate. The atmosphere was very bad. When he learnt a that I had got 95 marks in a test he told me A failure, You lost a5 marks.  I was very angry, not because my marks were lower athan his, but because I could not tolerate his pride. I did not ashow my discontentment and carried on doing my work.
sadness;This issue worried me rather than saddening me. In mid September a I went to Guanggho alone. I was looking for an accomodation in a the evening and after having walked 2 or 3 miles I still could not a find anything. What could I do? I was not worried about a sleeping on the streets but because of some procedural problems. a I finally found a place to sleep at 8 o'clock.
disgust;My roommate liked to listen to some meaningless songs which had a melody but had no content. We lived together so when he played a the recorder I was forced to listen to them. I could not tell a him that I did not like to listen to the songs, as I had no right a to disturb the freedom of others. So I would find a pretext to a leave the room and go somewhere else.
shame;Last Summer I went camping with some C.U students. As I was a working then, I had to leave the second night (some of them had a joined us the first night). Next morning, 6 o'clock, a female a classmate knocked on our door and tried to wake us up. I was not a fully conscious and I said something which I should not have.

anger;Two years back someone invited me to be the tutor of her a grand-daughter. The grand-daughter asked me some questions in a mathematics so I taught her. However she did not listen to me a and this made me feel unhappy. The second year it was the same. a When I entered university the girl's parents suggested that I be a employed as their daghters tutor. They told me that at university a there was no homework and I would have a lot of time so they a made a time-table for me which required me to be the tutor five a days a week. They did not respect me and anyway I had another a child to teach.
sadness;I had taken the responsibility to do something and I had a prepared for it. However I failed because of my timidity. After a three attempts I still could not adapt to the atmosphere and a failed as before. I felt imcompetent and felt that the others a would think that I had not prepared for it.
disgust;I was at home and I heard a loud sound of spitting outside the a door. I thought that one of my family members would step on the spit a and bring the germs in the house.

guilt;I had shouted at my younger brother and he was always afraid when a I called out loudly.
